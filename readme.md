### Test assignment

We'd like you to produce automation for deploying a [node application][repo].

* This has to include provisioning the infrastructure/services on AWS;
* Deploy on kubernetes cluster;
* Project doesn't have to be necessarily deployed as is - can use your own fork if you need to implement some best practices on top of that project;
* Deployment has to be scalable to a feature branch - we want to be able to easily deploy another fork/branch with the same configuration and setup and have them loadbalanced - make an example or document how you would do it;
* We expect to see documentation on how to manage configuration, duplicate the setup to totally other application.

We do not expect you to spend more than you think is appropriate. Be sure to include
* the total time spent;
* description of what you would've done if time permitted.

For any questions [contact us][contact].
